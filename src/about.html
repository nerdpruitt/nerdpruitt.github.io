    <h1>I am a front end web developer and designer from Nashville, TN, and I like making things.</h1>

    <p>For fifteen years, I have been designing and developing websites. I’ve been fortunate enough to do a little bit of everything over the course of my career. I have lead a team in graphic standards across a large e-commerce site, developed the front end of a travel agency booking system, created a mailing admin with dynamic template building, kept a legacy codebase up and running while rebuilding it piece by piece, created a patient managed care single page application, developed an HTML and CSS system that tightly integrated with a CMS powering over 600 web sites (before it was cool), and I have designed and developed a video game (just for the fun of it), to name a few highlights.</p>

    <p>I have never neatly fit into a single category in our industry because I’m too dang curious. I was the kid who was always drawing and reading. In college I earned a BFA in Graphic Design and taught myself how to code while working a summer internship on the web team at a large corporation. I progressed from simple HTML and CSS to Sass to jQuery to BackboneJS and VueJS to writing most things from scratch these days.</p>

    <p>I believe the fun in building software is in figuring things out, in learning something new, in crafting something elegant that I made myself and am proud of, and that I know will benefit and serve those who use it. I simply like solving problems and making things, and I plan to continue doing so for quite some time.</p>
